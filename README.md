# Probability and Statistics from Scratch

These modules contain the implementation of probability and statistics concepts using Python and Matplotlib (+ numpy for rounding floats and relevant constants i.e. euler's number)

Implemented:
- Probability:
  - Events and sample spaces
  - Probality of an event
  - Probability of the union of events
  - Probability of the intersection of events
  - Conditional Probability
  - Probability distributions (with plotting and CDFs)
    - Discrete
      - Bernoulli
      - Binomial
      - Geometric
      - Poisson
      - Discrete Uniform
    - Continuous
      - Uniform
      - Exponential
      - Normal
- Datasets:
  - Dataset loader from csv (in raw Python)
- Statistics
  - Mean, mode and median
  - Variance and standard deviation
  - Covariance and correlation
  - Correlation matrix plotting
  - Histogram
  - Scatter plot
  - Box plot
  - Bar plot
  - Simplified version of confidence interval for means and proportions
